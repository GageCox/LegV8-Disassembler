# LegV8-Disassembler
Disassembler for LegV8 in C

This program was made for the final project for CS205 at MHCC.
The program takes binary commands from user input and stores them in a .txt file.
The file is then read line by line and checks if the commands are valid before translating to LegV8 and outputting the result.
